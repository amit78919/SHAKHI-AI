Shakhi AI - Kaggle ,Gen AI Exchange Hackathon 2025 (Project)
Overview
Sakhi AI is an offline, voice-first, local-language AI companion designed specifically for rural Indian women. Built using Gemma 3n, it empowers women to share their thoughts, receive empathetic responses, and track their emotional health— all while prioritizing privacy, cultural sensitivity, and offline accessibility.

Problem Statement
Millions of women in rural India suffer in silence due to emotional neglect, patriarchal restrictions, mental health stigma, and lack of privacy. Smartphones may have reached villages, but AI solutions have not reached their hearts.

They need someone who doesn't judge, doesn't gossip, and just listens. But in low-connectivity areas, global AI fails.

Solution - Shakhi AI
Shakhi AI becomes a "shakhi" (friend) who:

Listens in local languages (Hindi & Hinglish)

Speaks softly, with empathy

Works 100% offline on entry-level smartphones

Tracks mood/emotions locally

Reminds pregnant women about essential vaccines & nutrition

Stores no cloud data - user remains private

Built with Gemma 3n, it is optimized for private, on-device LLM inference.
